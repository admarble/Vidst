# Task 3 Completed: Common Error Handling Patterns

I have implemented common error handling patterns for the service interfaces as required by task 3. Here is a summary of what has been accomplished:

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling System

Created a comprehensive error handling system in `src/core/services/error_handling.py` that includes:

- **EnhancedServiceError**: An extended error class with metadata for better classification and handling
- **ErrorCategory**: Enum for categorizing errors (network, timeout, authentication, etc.)
- **ErrorSeverity**: Enum for error severity levels (debug, info, warning, error, critical)
- **handle_service_errors**: Decorator for consistent error handling across services
- **is_retryable_error**: Function to determine if an error should be retried
- **classify_error**: Function to automatically classify exceptions into categories

## 2. Simplified Service Interface

Created a simplified service interface in `src/core/services/simplified.py` that provides:

- **SimpleServiceConfig**: Standardized configuration with common options
- **SimpleService**: Base class with integrated error handling, circuit breaker, and retry logic
- Standardized methods for initialization, shutdown, and health checks
- The `execute_with_retry` method for consistent retry behavior

## 3. Example Implementation and Testing

- Created an example implementation in `src/core/services/example_simplified.py`
- Created a test script in `src/core/services/test_integration.py` that verifies normal operation and error handling
- Created comprehensive documentation in `src/core/services/README.md`
- Updated `src/core/services/__init__.py` to expose the new interfaces

## Key Improvements

- **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent approach to handling errors across all services
- **Intelligent Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for transient errors with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Prevents cascading failures and allows services to recover
- **Simplified Configuration**: Streamlined configuration management with sensible defaults
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guidance for developers implementing services

All acceptance criteria for task 3 have been satisfied:

- ✅ Service interfaces are simplified and standardized
- ✅ Common error handling patterns are implemented
- ✅ Configuration management is streamlined
- ✅ Documentation for service interfaces is created
