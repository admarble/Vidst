### Key Components

#### Core Module (`src/video_understanding/core/`)

This module provides the foundation of the video processing system:

- **Configuration Management**: `config.py` defines processing and video configurations
- **Processing Pipeline**: `processing.py` implements video processing workflows
- **Scene Analysis**: `scene.py` provides scene detection and analysis
- **Input/Output Handling**: `input.py` and `output.py` manage data flow
- **Metrics Tracking**: `metrics.py` tracks performance and processing metrics
- **Error Handling**: `exceptions.py` defines specialized error types

#### Video Module (`src/video_understanding/video/`)

Handles video-specific functionality:

- **Metadata Extraction**: `metadata.py` extracts technical metadata from videos
- **Processing**: `processor.py` implements video processing operations
- **Status Tracking**: `status.py` tracks the processing state of videos
- **Upload Management**: `upload.py` handles video file uploads
- **Validation**: `validator.py` validates video files and formats

#### AI Module (`src/video_understanding/ai/`)

Integrates various AI models for video understanding:

- **Model Implementations**:
  - `GPT4VModel`: Vision capabilities from OpenAI
  - `GeminiModel`: Google's multimodal AI model
  - `WhisperModel`: Audio transcription
  - `TwelveLabsModel`: Video understanding platform
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Manages the flow of data between models
- **Error Handling**: Specialized error types for AI-related issues

#### Models (`src/video_understanding/models/`)

Defines data structures for representing video content:

- **Video**: Comprehensive model for video files with metadata and processing state
- **Scene**: Representation of video scenes with timing and content

#### Storage (`src/video_understanding/storage/ and /video_understanding/storage/`)

Manages data persistence:

- **Vector Storage**: For embeddings to enable semantic search
- **File Storage**: For video files and processing results

## Component Interactions

### Video Processing Flow

1. **Upload**: Video files are uploaded and validated
2. **Processing**: The core processor extracts metadata and prepares the video
3. **Scene Detection**: Videos are segmented into meaningful scenes
4. **AI Analysis**: Multiple AI models analyze the video content:
   - Object detection identifies visible items
   - Text extraction reads on-screen text
   - Audio transcription converts speech to text
   - AI models generate content understanding
5. **Storage**: Results are stored in structured formats and vector embeddings

### AI Model Integrations

The system integrates multiple AI models that work together:

- **GPT-4V**: Provides general visual understanding and content description
- **Gemini**: Additional multimodal capabilities for scene understanding
- **Whisper**: Specialized audio transcription with speaker identification
- **TwelveLabs**: Video-specific understanding and indexing

These models are orchestrated through a pipeline that combines their outputs for comprehensive video understanding.

## Development Environment

### Setup and Dependencies

The project uses modern Python tooling:

- **Python 3.10+** requirement
- **Package Management**: Configured with hatchling
- **Code Quality**: Enforced with black, isort, ruff, and other linting tools
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- **Documentation**: Generated with Sphinx

### Testing Approach

The project includes various test types:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Evaluating system efficiency
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete workflows

Test coverage is tracked with coverage goals specified in configuration.

## Entry Points and Usage

Based on the `examples/basic_usage.py` file, the primary usage pattern is:

1. Load video using the `Video` class
2. Configure components with appropriate configuration objects
3. Process the video with the `VideoProcessor`
4. Extract scenes with the `SceneDetector`
5. Analyze content with specialized detectors and recognizers

## Recommendations

### Code Navigation

- Start with `examples/basic_usage.py` to understand the primary usage patterns
- Explore the core module to understand the system architecture
- Refer to the model definitions to understand data structures
- Examine tests to see component interactions

### Areas for Further Exploration
