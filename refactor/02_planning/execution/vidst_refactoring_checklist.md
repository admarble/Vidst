# Vidst Refactoring Checklist

## Overview
This checklist outlines the key tasks required to refactor the Vidst video understanding project according to the refactoring master plan. The refactoring will transform the current architecture into an API-centric design, significantly reducing complexity while maintaining or improving core functionality.

## Tagging System

Throughout this checklist, tasks are tagged to indicate their priority:
- [POC] - Essential for proof-of-concept demonstration
- [OPT] - Optional enhancement that improves the POC but is not essential
- [FUT] - Future enhancement that can be deferred beyond the POC

All tasks without explicit tags should be considered [POC] by default.

## Scope Management Framework

To maintain scope discipline throughout the project, we will:

1. **Perform Weekly Scope Reviews**
   - Review all tasks against POC requirements
   - Verify alignment with "minimum viable" definitions
   - Document and defer any non-essential enhancements

2. **Apply "Good Enough for POC" Standards**
   - Simplify implementations to meet immediate needs
   - Avoid over-engineering and excessive abstraction
   - Focus on demonstrating core functionality

3. **Distinguish POC vs. Production Requirements**
   - Explicitly label functionality as POC or future enhancement
   - Document architectural vision separately from implementation
   - Maintain focus on the 6-week timeline

## Starting Approach Recommendation
Based on the analysis of the refactor documentation and current implementation, I recommend using a **hybrid approach** rather than starting from scratch:

1. **Use the existing code as a foundation**: The current codebase already has a strong architecture with well-defined interfaces.
2. **Progressively replace components**: Replace one component at a time, testing thoroughly after each replacement.
3. **Maintain clean abstractions**: Use factory patterns and interfaces to allow switching between implementations.

This approach will be faster and more productive than starting from scratch because:
- It leverages existing well-designed abstractions
- It allows for incremental testing and validation
- It reduces the risk of introducing new bugs
- It ensures compatibility with existing systems
