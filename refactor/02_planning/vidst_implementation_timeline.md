## 8. Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a realistic and detailed plan for refactoring the Vidst project to an API-centric architecture. By following this timeline and monitoring progress against the defined metrics, the project can achieve its refactoring goals within the POC timeframe.

The phased approach prioritizes high-impact components while building a foundation of robust abstractions and testing infrastructure. The buffer time and contingency planning help mitigate risks, and the comprehensive validation strategy ensures all success metrics are met.

By the end of the 6-week timeline, the project will have a significantly simpler architecture centered around managed API services while maintaining or improving all core functionality.
