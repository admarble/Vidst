## Using This Document

1. **During Planning:**
   - Reference these criteria when planning implementation details
   - Use to determine minimum scope for each component

2. **During Implementation:**
   - Check implementation against these criteria
   - Push additional features to backlog for post-POC phase

3. **During Review:**
   - Verify components meet the defined acceptance criteria
   - Use as basis for determining when components are "done"
