# Vidst Implementation Checklist for Junior Developers

Use this checklist to track your progress as you implement the new file structure and begin development on the API-centric architecture for the Vidst refactoring project.

## Phase 1: File Structure Setup

### Directory Creation
- [ ] Create a backup of current structure
- [ ] Create new AI module directories (`ocr`, `transcription`, `scene`)
- [ ] Create new config directories
- [ ] Create vector storage directories
- [ ] Create utils directories
- [ ] Create scripts directory

### Base Interface Files
- [ ] Create OCR service interface files
- [ ] Create transcription service interface files
- [ ] Create scene detection interface files
- [ ] Create vector storage interface files
- [ ] Create new model files

### Factory Pattern Files
- [ ] Create AI factory file
- [ ] Create vector storage factory file
- [ ] Create configuration factory files

### Utility Classes
- [ ] Create retry mechanism file
- [ ] Create circuit breaker implementation file
- [ ] Create migration and benchmark script files

### Add Init Files
- [ ] Add `__init__.py` to all directories

### Validation
- [ ] Verify directory structure
- [ ] Verify key files exist
- [ ] Commit changes to version control

## Phase 2: High Priority Component Implementation (Week 1-2)

### Scene Detection (Twelve Labs)
- [ ] Implement base interface content
- [ ] Enhance Twelve Labs client
- [ ] Implement scene detection service
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Write unit tests

### Vector Storage (Pinecone)
- [ ] Implement base interface content
- [ ] Implement Pinecone client
- [ ] Create vector migration utility
- [ ] Implement vector storage factory
- [ ] Write unit tests

### OCR Service (Document AI)
- [ ] Implement base interface content
- [ ] Implement Document AI client
- [ ] Create OCR service with fallback
- [ ] Integrate with frame processing
- [ ] Write unit tests

## Phase 3: Medium Priority Component Implementation (Week 3-4)

### Audio Transcription
- [ ] Complete Whisper implementation
- [ ] Implement transcription interface
- [ ] Create hybrid approach
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Write unit tests

### Documentation Consolidation
- [ ] Analyze current documentation systems
- [ ] Create migration plan
- [ ] Execute documentation migration
- [ ] Update build processes
- [ ] Verify documentation

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 5-6)

### End-to-End Integration
- [ ] Complete component integration
- [ ] Implement end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Address any open issues

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests
- [ ] Create test scenarios
- [ ] Add performance tests
- [ ] Run validation tests

### Final Validation
- [ ] Validate against success metrics
- [ ] Create POC demonstration
- [ ] Prepare final reports

## Success Metrics to Track

Track your progress against these key success metrics:

- [ ] Scene Detection Accuracy: >90%
- [ ] OCR Accuracy: >95%
- [ ] Speech Transcription Accuracy: >95%
- [ ] Processing Speed: Maximum 2x video duration
- [ ] Query Response Time: <2 seconds
- [ ] Query Relevance: >85% relevant responses

## Notes on Development Approach

Remember these key principles as you implement the new structure:

1. **Focus on interfaces first**: Define clean abstractions before implementing specific providers
2. **Use factory patterns**: This allows easy switching between implementations
3. **Implement resilience patterns**: Retry mechanisms and circuit breakers are essential for API stability
4. **Test thoroughly**: Write unit tests for each component
5. **Document as you go**: Keep documentation updated with implementation details
