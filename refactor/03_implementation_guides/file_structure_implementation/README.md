# Vidst File Structure Implementation Guide - START HERE

## Overview - Read This First

This directory contains comprehensive implementation guides, templates, scripts, and checklists for transitioning the Vidst project to the new API-centric architecture. These resources are designed to help developers, particularly junior team members, successfully implement the file structure changes outlined in the refactoring plan.

## Usage Instructions

**This README is your starting point for implementing the new file structure.**

1. **Read This README Completely**
   - Understand the overall approach and available resources
   - Get familiar with the directory structure and contents

2. **Next, Read the Implementation Guide**
   - Continue with the `guides/implementation_guide.md` for a detailed walkthrough
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions for implementation

3. **Review the Checklist**
   - Use `guides/implementation_checklist.md` to track your progress
   - Follow the phased implementation approach

4. **Use the Templates**
   - Copy the templates to the appropriate locations in your project
   - Adapt them as needed for your specific implementation

5. **Run the Automation Script**
   - The `scripts/create_file_structure.sh` script automates the creation of directories and files
   - Make the script executable: `chmod +x scripts/create_file_structure.sh`
   - Run it from the project root: `./refactor/03_implementation_guides/file_structure_implementation/scripts/create_file_structure.sh`

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a hybrid approach:

1. **Use the existing code as a foundation**
   - Leverage the current well-designed architecture
   - Add new abstractions and interfaces

2. **Progressively replace components**
   - Replace one component at a time
   - Test thoroughly after each replacement

3. **Maintain clean abstractions**
   - Use factory patterns and interfaces
   - Allow switching between implementations

## Key Deliverables

By following these guides, you'll implement:

1. **New Directory Structure**
   - Organized around API-centric components
   - Clear separation of interfaces and implementations

2. **Interface Abstractions**
   - Base classes for all major components
   - Factory patterns for component selection

3. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

4. **API Integration Foundation**
   - Structure for Twelve Labs integration
   - Framework for Pinecone vector storage
   - Setup for Google Document AI
