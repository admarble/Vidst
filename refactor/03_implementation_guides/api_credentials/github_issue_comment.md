# Implementation Guide for Issue #88

This issue involves setting up and documenting API credentials in the `.env` file for our external service integrations as part of our refactoring to an API-first architecture.

## Resources Created for Junior Developer

I've prepared the following resources to help implement this task:

1. **Detailed Task Plan**: A step-by-step guide for implementing the changes
2. **credentials.py Example**: A reference implementation for the credentials module
3. **.env.example Template**: A template for the environment variables file
4. **Test Implementation**: Example tests for the credentials module

These resources are located in the `/refactor/03_implementation_guides/api_credentials/` directory.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation should follow these key steps:

1. Create a `.env.example` template file in the project root
2. Implement a credentials utility module in `src/vidst/utils/credentials.py`
3. Add appropriate unit tests for the credentials module
4. Create documentation in the `docs/` directory
5. Test the integration with API service modules

The task is straightforward but critical for our refactoring strategy which replaces custom implementations with managed API services.
