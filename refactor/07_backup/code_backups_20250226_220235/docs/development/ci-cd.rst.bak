-----------------




-----------------



The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

1. Code Quality Checks
2. Unit Tests
3. Integration Tests
4. Documentation Build
5. Package Build
6. Deployment

Workflow Setup


--------------



The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`_:

.. code-block:: yaml

         name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
      push:
         branches: [ main, develop ]
      pull_request:
         branches: [ main, develop ]

   jobs:
      quality:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:

         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
               python-version: '3.10'
         - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
               python -m pip install --upgrade pip
               pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
         - name: Run linters
            run: |
               black --check .
               pylint src tests
               mypy src

      test:
         needs: quality
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:

         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
               python-version: '3.10'
         - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
               python -m pip install --upgrade pip
               pip install -r requirements.txt
               pip install -r requirements-test.txt
         - name: Run tests
            run: |
               pytest tests/unit
               pytest tests/integration

      docs:
         needs: test
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:

         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
               python-version: '3.10'
         - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
               python -m pip install --upgrade pip
               pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
         - name: Build documentation
            run: |
               cd docs
               make html
         - name: Deploy documentation
            if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
               github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
               publish_dir: ./docs/_build/html

Quality Requirements


--------------------



Quality Gates





The pipeline enforces the following quality gates:

1. Code formatting (Black)
2. Linting (Pylint)
3. Type checking (MyPy)
4. Test coverage (minimum 90%)
5. Documentation build success

Environment Configuration





Deployment Targets





The pipeline supports the following deployment environments:

1. Development (develop branch)
2. Staging (release branches)
3. Production (main branch)

Each environment has its own configuration and deployment process.

Required Variables





The following environment variables must be configured in the GitHub repository settings:

1. ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` - OpenAI API key for GPT-4V
2. ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` - Google Gemini Pro Vision API key
3. ``TWELVE_LABS_API_KEY`` - Twelve Labs API key
4. ``WHISPER_API_KEY`` - Whisper API key

These variables are automatically injected into the pipeline during execution.

Pipeline Management





Manual Steps





While most of the pipeline is automated, the following steps require manual intervention:

1. Version bumping for releases
2. Production deployment approval
3. API key rotation

Monitoring




The pipeline is monitored using:

1. GitHub Actions dashboard
2. Email notifications for failures
3. Slack notifications for deployments

Contact the development team for access to monitoring tools.
