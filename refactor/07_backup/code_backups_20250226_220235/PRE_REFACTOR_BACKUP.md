# Pre-Refactoring Backup

This directory contains a complete backup of the Vidst codebase **before** the refactoring process began.

## Backup Details

- **Date:** February 26, 2025
- **Purpose:** Pre-refactoring backup
- **Contents:**
  - `src/` - Core source code
  - `tests/` - Test suite
  - `video_understanding/` - Video processing modules
  - `examples/` - Example code
  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts
  - `docs/` - Documentation

## Restoration Instructions

If you need to restore this backup:

1. Identify the specific files or directories you need to restore
2. Copy them to the appropriate location in the project
3. Run tests to ensure functionality is restored

Example:

```bash
# To restore the entire src directory
cp -R refactor/07_backup/code_backups_20250226_220235/src /path/to/project/

# To restore a specific file
cp refactor/07_backup/code_backups_20250226_220235/src/specific_file.py /path/to/project/src/
```

## Important Note

This backup represents the original state of the codebase before refactoring. It's recommended to use Git for tracking changes during the refactoring process, and only use this backup as a reference or for emergency recovery.
