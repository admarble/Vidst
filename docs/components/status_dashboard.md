## Implementation Priorities

For the POC, we are focusing on the following priorities:

1. **Scene Detection**: Core functionality for video understanding
2. **Audio Transcription**: Essential for speech analysis
3. **Vector Storage**: Required for efficient search and retrieval
4. **Documentation**: Critical for demonstrating POC value

OCR and Natural Language Querying are planned for future development phases.
