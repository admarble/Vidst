# Archived Sphinx Documentation

This directory contains Sphinx documentation archived during the MkDocs consolidation.
Archived on: March 1, 2025

## Reason for Archiving

As part of the Vidst documentation consolidation (Issue #109), we've migrated from a dual documentation system (Sphinx + MkDocs) to a single MkDocs-based system. This change was made to:

1. Reduce maintenance overhead
2. Simplify the documentation process
3. Focus on essential documentation for the POC
4. Improve clarity about implementation status

## Contents

This archive contains the original Sphinx configuration files and documentation structure:

- `conf.py`: Sphinx configuration
- `Makefile`: Build scripts
- `_build/`: Generated documentation
- `_static/`: Static assets
- `_templates/`: Template files
- `_ext/`: Sphinx extensions

## Note on Usage

This archived documentation is maintained for reference only and is no longer actively updated. Please refer to the current MkDocs-based documentation for up-to-date information about the Vidst project.
