# [01.3 - Week 1] Service Interfaces Simplification - Task 3

## Description

This PR implements task 3 of issue #118: "Implement common error handling patterns" for the service interfaces simplification. The implementation provides standardized error handling, configuration management, and common patterns for services.

## Changes Made

1. Created a comprehensive error handling system in `src/core/services/error_handling.py`
2. Implemented a simplified service interface in `src/core/services/simplified.py`
3. Created an example implementation in `src/core/services/example_simplified.py`
4. Added integration tests in `src/core/services/test_integration.py`
5. Created documentation in `src/core/services/README.md`
6. Updated `src/core/services/__init__.py` to expose the new interfaces

## Key Features

- Enhanced error classification and categorization
- Standardized error logging
- Centralized retry mechanism
- Circuit breaker integration
- Error severity levels
- Retryable error detection

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the integration test script `src/core/services/test_integration.py`, which verifies:

- Normal operation of the simplified service interface
- Error handling with retries and circuit breaker
- Different error categories and severity levels
- Service lifecycle (initialization, operation, shutdown)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Service interfaces are simplified and standardized
- [x] Common error handling patterns are implemented
- [x] Configuration management is streamlined
- [x] Documentation for service interfaces is created
