## Test Results for Task 4: Configuration Management Streamlining

I've created and run a comprehensive test script to verify that the service interface implementation works correctly. All tests have passed successfully:

1. **Direct Service Usage Test**: Verified that services can be created, initialized, used, and shut down directly.
2. **Factory-based Service Usage Test**: Verified that services can be created using the factory pattern.
3. **Configuration Validation Test**: Verified that invalid configurations are properly rejected.
4. **Retry Mechanism Test**: Verified that the retry mechanism works correctly for transient errors.

The implementation meets all the acceptance criteria and is ready for review.
